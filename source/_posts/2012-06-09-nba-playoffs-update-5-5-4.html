This is the sixth post in my series on <a href="http://viksalgorithms.blogspot.com/2012/05/predicting-nba-finals-with-r.html">predicting the NBA playoffs</a> with an algorithm.  After the Boston loss in their last game, the algorithm is now 5-4 in the playoffs.  Hopefully it is correct tonight! <br /><br /><b>Open Sourcing the Code</b><br /><br />I have had a couple of requests to open source the code, which I had planned to do at the end of this series of posts.  However, there is one stumbling block in that the data I am scraping cannot be redistributed (I think).  If anyone has access to box score data for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 seasons that has a public license, please let me know.  You can contact me via the email in my profile, or in the comments section.<br /><br />Being able to get the data would simplify things a lot, but I would still have to clean up and comment the code a bit.  Expect to see it out in a week or so.<br /><br /><b>Predictions</b><br /><br />The algorithm likes Miami tonight:  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2F0-9TZ-yFw/T9NVGmwMcQI/AAAAAAAAAJM/FQPPvOG7WjE/s1600/update_5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="99" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2F0-9TZ-yFw/T9NVGmwMcQI/AAAAAAAAAJM/FQPPvOG7WjE/s640/update_5.png" width="640" /></a></div>
