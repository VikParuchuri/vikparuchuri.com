<div class='post'>
I recently had a problem whereby I needed one Ruby program to spawn another Ruby program, but I did not need or want the two programs to interact after the second program was instantiated.  I solved this issue by using the system function in Ruby and the Windows start command.<br> <pre class="ruby">system('start ruby.exe C:\script.rb')</pre> This will create a new Ruby window, which will run the specified script, and close when it is complete.</div>
